Setup individual charges for each payment method in WooCommerce.

== Description ==

Add individual charges for each payment method as a flat rate and/or as a percentage of the cart total. The plugin first calculates the percentage rate and then adds the fixed rate on top.

You can use **placeholders** in the payment item title:

- *[FIXED_AMOUNT]*: Will print money-formatted fixed amount you entered.
- *[PERCENT_AMOUNT]*: will print out percental amount you entered
- *[CART_TOTAL]*: will print out money-formatted cart totals.
- Example: `Payment Fee ([FIXED_AMOUNT] + [PERCENT_AMOUNT]% of [CART_TOTAL])`

Requires at least WooCommerce 2.6, compatible with WooCommerce 3.2+ (recommended). The support for WC 2.6 will be dropped soon.

= Features =
- **Fixed charge and/or a percentage** of cart total
- Possibility to **disable for free/zero shipping**
- **Plugin API**. See [GitHub](https://github.com/vyskoczilova/woocommerce-payforpayment) for details.

= Compatibility =
- **WPML** (see [FAQ](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-pay-for-payment#faq))
- [WooCommerce Price Based on Country for WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-product-price-based-on-countries/) & PRO
- [Multi Currency for WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woo-multi-currency/)  & PRO
- [WooCommerce Multi-Currency](https://woocommerce.com/products/multi-currency/) when the store currency is USD

= Limitations =
- It seems that Mercadopago gateway is not handling WC_Fee correctly. Get in touch with Mercadopago support (and I'm happy to help them fix the issue)
- Better not use it with PayPal. (Legal issue, see FAQ as well.)
- Doesn't work on "Pay for order" pages (manually created orders or canceled payments), because of [WC limitations](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/issues/17794)

= Special Credits =
- to [Jörn Lund (@podpirate)](https://github.com/mcguffin/woocommerce-payforpayment) who have developed this plugin and abandoned it in 2016.

== Installation ==

Just follow the standard [WordPress plugin installation procedere](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins).

== Frequently asked questions ==

= Can I use it with PayPal? =

No. PayPal does not permit charging your customer for using PayPal. This is a legal issue rather than a technical one.
See [PayPal User Agreement](https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/ua/useragreement-full?country.x=US&locale.x=en_US#4), > "4.6 No Surcharges" for details.
You have been warned.

= WPML - How to translate? =
If you need to localize Fee title and Fixed charge go to go to WPML > String translation and look for following type of text domain: `woocommerce-pay-for-payment` and than you should find a strings with name "{payment-method-slug} - charges fixed" or "{payment-method-slug} - item title". See the second screenshot.

= Can't to setup my payment requirements in the user interface. The option I need is missing. =

The plugin user interface only offers either a fixed amout or a percentage of the carts subtotal.
If you need to implement more complex calcuations like 'no charges for orders above 100 Bucks' or '2% of cart subtotal but at least 2 Bucks',
you'll have to use one of the filters. See [Plugin API](https://github.com/vyskoczilova/woocommerce-payforpayment#plugin-api) for details.

<code>woocommerce_pay4pay_apply</code> specifies if a charge will be applied.

<code>woocommerce_pay4pay_applyfor_{$payment_gateway_id}</code> specifies if a charge will be applied on a certain payment method.

<code>woocommerce_pay4pay_{$payment_gateway_id}_amount</code> allows you to alter the amount of the charge being added.


= I want to use the latest files. How can I do this? =

Use the GitHub Repo rather than the WordPress Plugin. Do as follows:

1. If you haven't already done: [Install git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git)

2. In the console cd into Your 'wp-content/plugins´ directory

3. type `git clone https://github.com/vyskoczilova/woocommerce-payforpayment` or better type `git fork https://github.com/vyskoczilova/woocommerce-payforpayment`

4. If you want to update to the latest files (be careful, might be untested on Your WP-Version) type `git pull´.

= I found a bug. Where should I post it? =

I personally prefer GitHub, to keep things straight. The plugin code is here: [GitHub](https://github.com/vyskoczilova/woocommerce-payforpayment)
But you may use the WordPress Forum as well.

= I found a bug and fixed it. How can I contribute? =

Either post it on [GitHub](https://github.com/vyskoczilova/woocommerce-payforpayment) or—if you are working on a cloned repository—send me a pull request.
